**Video Processing Script**

This repository hosts a Python script for advanced video processing using OpenCV. The script provides a range of functionalities for enhancing and modifying video content, including:

**Face Detection and Blurring**: Automatically detects faces within video frames and applies blurring for privacy protection.

**Day/Night Detection**: Determines whether the video was recorded during the day or night based on frame brightness, enabling dynamic adjustments.

**Brightness Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts frame brightness to improve visibility, particularly useful for low-light conditions.

**Watermarking**: Integrates customizable watermarks into video frames, with the ability to switch between different watermark designs.

**Overlay Video Integration**: Enables the integration of overlay videos onto main video frames, allowing for dynamic video compositions.

**End Screen Addition**: Appends an end screen video to the processed output, providing a polished finish to videos.

This script offers a flexible solution for various video processing tasks, including privacy enhancement, content creation, and video editing automation.

Feel free to explore the script and adapt it to suit your specific video processing needs. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
